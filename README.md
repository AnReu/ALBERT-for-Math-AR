# ALBERT for Mathematical Answer Retrieval

We will publish the code for the paper "An ALBERT-based Similarity Measure for Mathematical Answer Retrieval" [SIGIR 2021] in this repository soon. 

Currently, we are re-writing the code using hugging face for a better compatibility and adaptability. Let me know, if you have any questions!
